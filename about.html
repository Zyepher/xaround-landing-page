              connect students on their campus. Students use these pages to
              anonymously share their opinions, secrets, relevant news, and many
              more with others on their campus. However, since Facebook Pages is
              not meant for hosting confession platforms, the page
              administrators and its followers both face their own unique
              problems.

              Page administrators’ problems include: (1) risk of accidental
              reposting of unlawful content, (2) page taken down by the Facebook

              the page followers' problems include: (1) wait for the page
              administrators to repost their submission, (2) receive fewer
              responses from others due to privacy concerns in the comment
              section, and (3) publish new separate posts in order to respond to
              a specific post anonymously.

              We have zero tolerance for bullying or harassment of any kind.
              Instead, we encourage constructive criticism. We acknowledge that
              sometimes criticism with good intentions may be falsely
              interpreted as bullying and harassment. Since it depends on the
              context, our moderators will manually judge them. Don’t post or
              comment with the intention of making someone feel bad. Don’t share
              personal or contact information of other people without their
              knowledge and consent.
