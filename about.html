          <p class="about-text">Campus confessions are typically hosted through Facebook Pages. Fellow students create a page for their campus as a medium to connect students on their campus. Students use these pages to anonymously share their opinions, secrets, relevant news, and many more with others on their campus. However, since Facebook Pages is not meant for hosting confession platforms, the page administrators and its followers both face their own unique problems.<br/><br/>Page administrators’ problems include: (1) risk of accidental reposting of unlawful content, (2) page taken down by the Facebook staff for violating Facebook’s Community Standards, and (3) continuously reposting content submissions. Meanwhile, the page followers' problems include: (1) wait for the page administrators to repost their submission, (2) receive fewer responses from others due to privacy concerns in the comment section, and (3) publish new separate posts in order to respond to a specific post anonymously.<br/><br/>This app proposes a new platform for hosting campus communities through a mobile app for greater accessibility from anywhere. The mission is to overcome the problems stated above, make more campuses available at scale, and provide a superior user experience. Users may participate in the app development discussions through an exclusive forum in the app to build the ideal platform together. Unlike Facebook Pages, xaround is built to host campus communities optimally – more than just a confession platform.</p>
