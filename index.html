             is where a lot of us spend most of our time on Reddit, so it has to
              be a fundamentally incredible experience. With awesome inline
              previews of links in comments, customizable gestures with swipe
              to collapse, full spoiler support, and tons of more options
              available via long-press, Apollo offers the best comment browsing
              experience in town.</p>

          <p>Reddit takes full advantage of Markdown, a really effortless way
            to format text with bold, italics, links, and much more. On mobile,
            it's never been easy to take advantage of these formatting features,
             but with Apollo you can let its Markdown editor do all the
              formatting and previewing for you so you can just focus on
               writing. Easy inline image and album uploads, too!</p>

            on your eyes at night, or you just prefer Dark Modes! In addition
            to being able to long-press the navigation bar to toggle it,
            there's also an option to have it come on automatically based on
            screen brightness or local sunset times.</p>
