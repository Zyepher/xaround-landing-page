              At xaround, we truly strive to contribute to human progress by
              empowering people to express themselves and share genuine insights
              while having fun together, as a community. We created these
              Community Guidelines to support our mission by encouraging the
              broadest range of self-expression while also at the same time,
              making sure everyone can use our service safely every day. These
              Guidelines apply to all content on the app. In certain cases, we
              won’t take action against content when it is newsworthy and
              relates to a matter of political, social, or other general concern
              to our community.

            <strong>Harassment & Bullying</strong>
            <p class="text-neutral-white setting">
              We have zero tolerance for bullying or harassment of any kind.
              Instead, we encourage constructive criticism. We acknowledge that
              sometimes criticism with good intentions may be falsely
              interpreted as bullying and harassment. Since it depends on the
              context, our moderators will manually judge them. Don’t post or
              comment with the intention of making someone feel bad. Don’t share
              personal or contact information of other people without their
              knowledge and consent.

            <strong>Threats, Violence & Harm</strong>
            <p class="text-neutral-white setting">
              Don’t threaten to harm a person, a group of people, or someone’s
              property. Encouraging violence is prohibited on xaround. Don't
              submit posts or comments of gratuitous violence, including animal
              abuse. We don’t allow the glorification of self-harm, including
              the promotion of self-injury or eating disorders.

            <strong>Impersonation & Spam</strong>
            <p class="text-neutral-white setting">
              Don’t pretend to be someone you’re not — this includes your
              friends, celebrities, brands, or other organizations — or attempt
              to deceive people about who you are. We prohibit spam and
              deceptive practices, including content that imitates xaround's
              advertisement formats.

            <strong>Hate Speech & False Information</strong>
            <p class="text-neutral-white setting">
              Don't post any content that demeans, defames, or promotes
              discrimination or violence on the basis of race, ethnicity,
              national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity,
              disability, or veteran status. We prohibit malicious deception and
              deliberately spreading false information that causes harm, such as
              denying the existence of tragic events.

            <strong>Illegal Content</strong>
            <p class="text-neutral-white setting">
              Don’t use xaround for any illegal activities — including to buy or
              sell illegal drugs, contraband, counterfeit goods, or illegal
              weapons.

            <strong>Terrorism</strong>
            <p class="text-neutral-white setting">
              Terrorist organizations are prohibited from using our platform and
              we have no tolerance for content that advocates or advances
              terrorism. Please remember that you can always file a report using
              our in-app reporting feature. We review these reports to determine
              whether there is a violation of these Guidelines and any action
              needs to be taken. If you violate these Community Guidelines, we
              may remove the offending content, mute your account, and/or notify
              law enforcement. If your account is muted for violating our Terms
              of Service or these Guidelines, you may still use the app but your
              account can no longer create a post or comment. Please take these
              Guidelines seriously and honor them in the spirit in which they
              are intended. We’ll do our best to enforce them consistently and
              fairly, and ultimately we’ll try to do what we think best reflects
              these values in each situation in our sole discretion.
